Malayfy: A Machine Learning-Based Bahasa Melayu Dialect Translator and Detector 

Malayfy is a language processing tool designed to detect and translate dialects of Bahasa Melayu using advanced machine learning algorithms. This project focuses on identifying various dialects within the Malay-speaking regions (such as Kelantan, Sabah, Johor, Kedah, Melaka, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang) and providing accurate translations between them. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and Random Forest algorithm, Malayfy aims to overcome the challenges posed by dialectal differences, ensuring seamless communication and understanding across different regions where Bahasa Melayu is spoken.
